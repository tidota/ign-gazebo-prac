# Practice for Ignition Gazebo

This repository is just my personal practice for Ignition Gazebo.

# ROS
The simulator is run with ROS.

# Model

Seems like it is impossible to load a model stored in a local machine.
It is required to publish a model to Fuel so that it can be loaded from their server.
